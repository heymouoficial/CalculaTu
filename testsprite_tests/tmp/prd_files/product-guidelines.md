# Product Guidelines: CalculaTú SmartWeb

## 1. Tone and Voice

CalculaTú will adopt a **Friendly and Approachable** tone and voice across all its communications and user interactions. This means using warm, informal, and supportive language that is easy for the average user to understand. The aim is to create a welcoming and helpful experience, making complex tasks feel simple and stress-free.

## 2. Visual Style and Aesthetic (Liquid Glass Supermarket Survival)

The visual design of CalculaTú is meticulously defined and implemented to create a "Liquid Glass Supermarket Survival" aesthetic. This approach is characterized by:

-   **Liquid Glass Aesthetic:** Extensive use of glassmorphism effects, including `backdrop-blur`, subtle transparencies, semi-transparent borders, and a distinctive teal/green glow. This is applied over a pure black background (`#000000`) with a very subtle gradient.
-   **Main Color Palette:**
    -   **Absolute Black:** The foundational background color.
    -   **Bright Teal/Green (approx. #00FFBC):** Used for positive actions, feedback, real-time BCV rates, and other prominent elements, conveying a sense of freshness and progress.
    -   **Pure White:** Employed for primary text to ensure maximum legibility against the dark background.
    -   **Dark Gray:** Utilized for secondary text and less prominent elements.
    -   **Soft Purple:** Appears specifically in chat icons, adding a touch of distinctiveness.
    -   **Red:** Reserved exclusively for critical actions, such as stopping a voice call, to draw immediate attention.
-   **Typography:** Features a bold, clean sans-serif typeface, chosen for its high contrast and readability, especially in varying light conditions.
-   **Savara Avatar:** The Savara AI avatar is circular and displays a teal glow halo when active or listening, providing clear visual feedback on its status.
-   **Fluid Micro-interactions:** Subtle and purposeful animations, such as a gentle pulse on the voice button, fade-in effects for status bubbles, and smooth entry animations, enhance user engagement without causing distraction.
-   **Aggressive Mobile-First Design:** The interface is specifically optimized for one-handed use in a supermarket environment, prioritizing elements within the "Thumb Zone." Large headers ensure quick visibility of totals, crucial for users in a hurry or with variable lighting and unstable connections.
-   **Priorities:** The design relentlessly focuses on extreme legibility, minimal battery and data consumption, and conveying a premium yet cozy feel, free from unnecessary distractions.

## 3. Brand Messaging

The brand messaging will echo the friendly and approachable tone, focusing on key benefits such as "stress-free shopping," "smart assistance," and "real-time insights." It will emphasize simplicity, efficiency, and the innovative integration of AI to enhance the shopping experience.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Principles

-   **Intuitive Navigation:** Design will prioritize ease of use, allowing users to quickly access core functionalities without extensive learning.
-   **Clear Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear visual/auditory feedback for all user actions, especially during calculations and AI interactions.
-   **Efficiency:** Streamline workflows to minimize steps and cognitive load, crucial for a fast-paced supermarket environment.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is usable by a wide range of users, considering legibility and touch-target sizes.
